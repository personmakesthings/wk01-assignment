        <p>Hey there Japan fans! Continuing our series looking at traditional Japanese leisure spots, today, we will be taking a look at the famous Japanese <i>ryokan</i>.</p>
        <p>What is a <i>ryokan</i>, you might ask? Luckily, Wikipedia is here to give us a quick and handy overview:</p>

        <p class="caption">"A ryokan (旅館) is a type of traditional Japanese inn that typically features tatami-matted rooms, communal baths, and other public areas where visitors may wear nemaki and talk with the owner."</p>

        <p>Now lets take a further look...</p>

        <div class="img-box">
            <img src="./images/blog-post-img3.jpg" class="round-corners img" width="650">
            <p class="caption">The rooms you find in a <i>ryokan</i> are in a traditional Japanese style. In them, you will find <i>tatami</i> (畳) mats arranged for flooring, and sliding doors called <i>fusuma</i> (襖).</p>
        </div>


        <div class="img-box">
            <img src="./images/blog-post-img1.jpg" class="round-corners img" width="650">
            <p class="caption">Ryokans are known for including food as part of their service for guests - a traditional Japanese bed and breakfast, if you like. The meals that are served are typically a mix of smaller dishes, often with locally sourced ingredients.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="img-box">
            <img src="./images/blog-post-img2.jpg" class="round-corners img" width="650">
            <p class="caption">The robes you may see guests wear at these inns are known as <i>nemaki</i> (ねまき). Can you spot any similarities and differences <i>nemaki</i> has to other traditional Japanese clothes? (It's also hard not to see the appeal of the <i>ryokan</i> when the vibes are this cosy...)</p>
        </div>

        <div class="img-box">
            <img src="./images/blog-post-img4.jpg" class="round-corners img" width="650">
            <p class="caption">Nearly all <i>ryokan</i> have common bathing areas segregated by gender, known as <i>ofuro</i> (お風呂). Those <i>ryokan</i> with hot springs nearby tend to source water from them.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="img-box">
            <img src="./images/feature4.jpg" class="round-corners img" width="650">
            <p class="caption">Some of the more expensive <i>ryokan</i> overlook a beautiful, traditional Japanese garden. Very relaxing and scenic.</p>
        </div>

        <p>And that's it for today! I hope you have enjoyed this quick look into one of Japan's most famous types of inn!</p>
